# General Tools TS-04 Multimeter Browser Interface using Web-Bluetooth

This is a project to create a minimal browser-based interface for the [General Tools TS-04 Multimeter](https://www.generaltools.com/ts04-digitalmultimeter). My intention is to make it possible to build alternative interfaces for the meter for people with a varying range of sensory abilities. Specifically, I want to make a web interface for the mooshimeter that is accessible to low-vision users.

For a detailed Description of the process of deciphering the protocol, see [this blog post](https://www.tigoe.com/pcomp/code/circuits/1309/).
